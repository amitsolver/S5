# S5
 Building Neural Network Architecture

 # MNIST CLASSIFICATION

 # Dataset
 The MNIST is a database of handwritten digits that is used for training image processing systems where digits needed to be identified

 # CNN Architecture
 Model artchiture consiste of 4 Conv layers, 2 Linear layes and 2 Max pooling layers. Relu is used as activation functions and Log_Softmax is being as a loss function.

 # Model.py
 Model.py contains the connvolution architecture used for classification. It includes conv layers, activation function, FC layers and loss function

 # Utils.py
 Utils.py contains preprocessing, transformations, train, test and evaluation functions

 # S5.ipynb
 It is execution module

 # How To Run
 Run S5.ipynb file

 # Metrics
 Average loss: 0.0000
 Accuracy: 99.35%
